Seems like a lot of the stuff I'm doing on my blog is scraping and NLp.... Not surprised since I'm looking for an nlp job.

Not no surprised that I'm on this website --- I need a job and my Alma mater is  kind enough to provide a jobfair twice a year. But the website is HORRIBLE. There is no search function for the websites, and the companies are listed alphabetically. [Jobfair 2018](https://www.partners4employment.ca/student-alumni/current-participating-organizations.htm)

--- That's okay. I'm a patient man. I wipe out my favorite tool, wget to get everything and grep for "web dev", "software" or something. Right?
 {% highlight bash %}
wget --recursive --no-parent https://www.partners4employment.ca/student-alumni
{% endhighlight %}
... so we get floor plans, info, but nothing about job descriptions. That's okay, they must live somewhere else.

Go back to the list, open in new tab... nothing. Oh god. Is this what I think it is?
![Company Details]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/company_details2.png)
<ul>
<li>Hint 1: Mouse over says `javascript: void(0)`</li>
<li>Hint 2: The url of each organization is the same as list url</li>
</ul>

Yep. The entire website navigation is done by a first year co-op student, or automatically generated by some really really old piece of code from 5 to 10 years ago.
{% highlight html %}
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="orbisApp.buildForm({action : 'displayRegInfo', registrationId : 3266}).submit();"> Accedo </a>
{% endhighlight %}

Okay, time to do something about it in part1.
